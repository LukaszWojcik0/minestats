# [Front+Backend]MineStats - Minecraft statistics web-app 

This app helps you track your and your friend's statistics on any server that supports MCRCON.

Currently, this app is still **in progress** but already looks well enough to be shared with public.
Backend still needs some work to be published.

**Main features:**
- Login page

- Live data of the server and connected players

Plans to expand:
- Adding a database so that more information can be stored for future statistics
- Adding a statistics tab for each player so that interesting information can be accesed from the app.
- Adding a on server integration that makes two above points possible, by reading statistics directly from the saved game
